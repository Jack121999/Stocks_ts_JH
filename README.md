# Stocks!
This app answers the question of "What if you invested in the stocks with the highest trade volume?" This can be done by selecting an industry and then the top three stocks by volume in that industry will be shown along with a plot of volume over time. You can then select the stocks in the graph on top, along with a date range, and view the open, close, high, low, and volume. Which one of those you want to plot is selectable by the user.
